Bruce is brought up in Wayne Manor, and leads a happy and privileged existence until the age of eight, when his parents are killed by a small-time criminal named Joe Chill while on their way home from a movie theater. That night, Bruce Wayne swears an oath to spend his life fighting crime. He engages in intense intellectual and physical training; however, he realizes that these skills alone would not be enough. \"Criminals are a superstitious cowardly lot,\" Wayne remarks, \"so my disguise must be able to strike terror into their hearts. I must be a creature of the night, black, terrible...\" As if responding to his desires, a bat suddenly flies through the window, inspiring Bruce to take on the persona of Batman.",
